## Context and Problem Statement
The application requires a feature for users to provide feedback on meat products and view feedback provided by other users.

## Decision Drivers
1. Single Responsibility: Ensure the feedback microfrontend focuses solely on managing feedback-related tasks.
2. Modular Architecture: Maintain a clear separation of concerns to facilitate maintainability and scalability.
3. User Experience: Provide users with a dedicated interface for giving and viewing feedback on meat products.
4. Independent Deployment: Enable independent updates and deployment of the feedback microfrontend to support continuous delivery and autonomy.

## Considered Options 
1. Integrate feedback functionality within the product management microfrontend.
2. Include feedback functionality as part of the liked/saved microfrontend.
3. Develop a standalone microfrontend dedicated to feedback microfrontend.

## Decision Outcome 
We decided to develop a dedicated microfrontend for feedback management to adhere to the principles of single responsibility, modular architecture, user experience, and independent deployment. By separating this functionality into its own microfrontend, we ensure a focused and efficient user experience while maintaining flexibility and scalability in the application architecture.

## Consequences  
- Good: Enhanced user experience, clear separation of concerns, and flexibility in managing feedback functionality.
- Bad: Potential overhead in managing an additional microfrontend, coordination challenges during integration with other microfrontends.
