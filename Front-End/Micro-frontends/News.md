## Context and Problem Statement
The application requires handling news-related data, including articles and statistics related to meats and supermarkets.

## Decision Drivers
1. Simplicity: Design a straightforward interface for managing and displaying news-related content.
2. Single Responsibility: Ensure the news microfrontend focuses solely on handling news-related tasks, such as fetching and presenting articles and statistics.
3. Independent Deployment: Facilitate independent deployment of the news microfrontend to support continuous delivery and autonomy.

## Considered Options 
1. Integrate news functionality within other microfrontends.
2. Develop a standalone microfrontend dedicated to news management, encompassing articles and statistics related to meats and supermarkets.

## Decision Outcome 
We decided to develop a dedicated microfrontend for news management to adhere to the principles of simplicity, single responsibility, and independent deployment. This approach ensures clear separation of concerns and allows for efficient management and presentation of news-related content, including articles and statistics.

## Consequences  
- Good: Improved maintainability, modular architecture, and flexibility in managing news-related data.
- Bad: Potential overhead in managing an additional microfrontend, coordination challenges during integration with other microfrontends.
