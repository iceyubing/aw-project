## Context and Problem Statement
The application requires managing supermarket-related data, including location, inventory, and categories.

## Decision Drivers
1. Simplicity: Design a straightforward interface for managing supermarket data.
2. Single Responsibility: Ensure the supermarket management microfrontend focuses solely on supermarket-related tasks.
3. Independent Deployment: Facilitate independent deployment of the supermarket management microfrontend to support continuous delivery and autonomy.
   
## Considered Options 
1. Integrate supermarket management functionality within other microfrontends, such as product management.
2. Develop a standalone microfrontend dedicated to supermarket management.

## Decision Outcome 
We decided to develop a dedicated microfrontend for supermarket management to adhere to the principles of simplicity, single responsibility, reusability, independent deployment, and vertical services. This approach ensures clear separation of concerns and allows for efficient management and evolution of supermarket-related features.

## Consequences  
- Good: Improved maintainability, modular architecture, and flexibility in managing supermarket data.
- Bad: Potential overhead in managing an additional microfrontend, coordination challenges during integration with other microfrontends.
