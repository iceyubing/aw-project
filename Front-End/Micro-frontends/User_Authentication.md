## Context and Problem Statement
The application requires user authentication to ensure secure access and personalization of content.

## Decision Drivers
1. Simplicity: Keep authentication process straightforward for users.
2. Single Responsibility: Ensure the authentication microfrontend handles only user authentication-related tasks.
3. Independent Deployment: Allow for separate deployment of authentication microfrontend to facilitate continuous delivery and autonomy.
4. Vertical Services: Support vertical slicing of functionality to align with autonomous teams' responsibilities.
5. Modular Architecture: Support modularization of authentication features to streamline development and maintenance.
   
## Considered Options
1. Implement authentication within each microfrontend.
2. Create a dedicated microfrontend for user authentication.

## Decision Outcome
We decided to create a dedicated microfrontend for user authentication to adhere to the principles of simplicity, single responsibility, independent deployment, and vertical services. This approach ensures clear separation of concerns and facilitates maintenance and evolution of authentication functionality.

## Consequences 
- Good: Enhanced security, user experience, modular architecture, and flexibility in managing authentication-related features.
- Bad: Slight overhead in managing an additional microfrontend, potential coordination overhead during integration with other microfrontends.
