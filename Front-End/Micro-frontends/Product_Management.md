## Context and Problem Statement
The application requires managing product-related data, including featured meats and detailed information for all available meats.

## Decision Drivers
1. Simplicity: Design a user-friendly interface for managing product-related data.
2. Single Responsibility: Ensure the product management microfrontend focuses solely on product-related tasks.
3. Reusability: Enable reuse of product management functionality across different parts of the application.
4. Independent Deployment: Facilitate independent deployment of the product management microfrontend to support continuous delivery and autonomy.

## Considered Options 
1. Integrate product management functionality within other microfrontends.
2. Develop a standalone microfrontend dedicated to product management.

## Decision Outcome 
We decided to develop a dedicated microfrontend for product management to adhere to the principles of simplicity, single responsibility, reusability, and independent deployment. This approach ensures clear separation of concerns and allows for efficient management and presentation of product-related data.

## Consequences  
- Good: Improved maintainability, modular architecture, and flexibility in managing product-related data.
- Bad: Potential overhead in managing an additional microfrontend, coordination challenges during integration with other microfrontends.
